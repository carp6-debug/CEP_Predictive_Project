# 🤖 AI Governance & Compliance Statement

## 📝 Statement of Methodology
This project utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically as a **Senior Systems Architect Consultant**. The use of AI was targeted toward accelerating the "Architectural Prototyping" phase, specifically during the initial Dual-Schema (Staging/Star) drafting and the implementation of the .NET Service Layer boilerplate.

## 🛡️ Operational Safeguards
* **Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)**: Every SQL constraint, C# Dapper query, and Python telemetry loop was manually verified, refactored, and performance-tested by the lead developer. AI was not permitted to commit code or interact with the PostgreSQL environment directly.
* **Algorithmic Integrity**: While AI assisted in generating Gaussian noise logic for the simulator, the actual **Predictive Thresholds** (Critical > 3.4 mm/s) were determined through exploratory data analysis in the `predictive_asset_analytics.ipynb` notebook.
* **Data Privacy**: No proprietary or project-specific sensitive data was shared with external AI models. All prompts were restricted to architectural structure and public-domain NYC Open Data schemas.

## 🎯 Professional Value
AI integration allowed for a 40% reduction in structural development time, allowing the developer to focus on **Telemetric Accuracy**, **Predictive Risk Modeling**, and **N-Tier System Resilience**.
